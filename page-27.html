              Since its launch, Sybrava has garnered over 900 patients, with
              two-thirds enrolling in the Sybrava Patient Support Program (PSP),
              known as ADOPT. However, a significant dropout rate of 63% has
              been observed from the 3rd dose onward.
            </li>
            <li>
              Market research insights from patients indicate that cost is a
              major factor influencing adherence. Patients are more inclined to
              continue treatment if the monthly cost is below a threshold of RM
              XX, in contrast to the current price range is between RMXX to RMXX
              per injection for Sybrava.
            </li>
            <li>
              To address this issue, the team has been identifying other
              financial options to improve patient access following the
              discontinuation of PSP in January 2024.

              This program aims to collaborate with Pine Lab and the KPJ
              Healthcare group to offer the installment plan as an option for
              outpatients who are prescribed but face challenges with the high
              upfront payment. Roll-out date : 2nd May 2025.

            <li>
              Pine Lab is a fintech company available in providing credit card
              facilities at all KPJ hospitals. They offer installment plans for
              major credit card companies, but currently, these plans are only
              available for in-patient treatment costs, while most Sybrava
              prescriptions are for outpatient consultations.
            </li>
            <li>
              The team is piloting a program targeting the 2 KPJ hospitals
              (Damansara Specialist, and Tawakal Hospital) with the highest
              credit card utilization. Once streamlined, the program will expand
              to all KPJ hospitals nationwide and, if successful, to other
              private hospitals in Malaysia.

            Partnering with a FinTech that already provides credit card
            facilities expedited buy-in from KPJ group; nevertheless, extended
            timelines for legal and data protection alignments among all parties
            should be anticipated.
